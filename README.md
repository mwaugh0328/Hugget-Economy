# Hugget-Economy
Solves and Simulates the [Huggett JEDC (1993) Economy](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/dyncon/v17y1993i5-6p953-969.html)

This provides a set of code that solves and simulates the Huggett economy. I really like this model. It is a nice instance where the primitives + dynamic behavior induce a demand and supply curve for assets. The interst rate is found so that demand and supply are equall. It closely follows the presentation and numerical results discussed in [Recursive Macroeconomic Theory.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recursive-macroeconomic-theory-fourth-edition#:~:text=Recursive%20Macroeconomic%20Theory%20offers%20both,the%20book%20provides%20many%20applications.)

Two folders contain code to compute the Huggett Economy

- [Julia version](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/Hugget-Economy/tree/master/hugget-julia) with several approaches to solving the model using non-linear solvers to solve the value function, stationary distribution, and an equillibrium.

- [Matlab version](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/Hugget-Economy/tree/master/hugget-matlab).
